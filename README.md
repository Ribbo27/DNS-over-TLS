# DNS over TLS Proxy

A simple python DNS over TLS proxy implementation

## Quickstart

#### TO-DO

## N26 - SRE Challenge

### Requirements

From your understanding of the topic, we would expect a working example of a DNS to
DNS-over-TLS proxy that can:
1. Handle at least one DNS query, and give a result to the client.
2. Work over TCP and talk to a DNS-over-TLS server that works over TCP (e.g: Cloudflare).
